# Flix

Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

üìù `UNIT 2 OVERVIEW:` 

In this unit you'll learn how to build a Detail View, an extremely common feature found in almost every app. A Detail View allows users to get more "details" about something in your app, usually by tapping on an item in a list to reveal a new "screen" which slides in from the right. We'll use this design pattern to extend our Flicks app so users can get more info about particular movies.

We'll also explore tab bars, another type of navigation, and try our hand with collection views to achieve a grid layout of movie cells. We'll continue to extend our Tumblr app as well adding a detail view. For an extra challenge, add section headers to your table view and leverage a pinch gesture recognizer to allow users to zoom in on an image.
